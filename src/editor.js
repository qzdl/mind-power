With regard to [[file:20201019T141648Z-notetaking.org][note-taking]], analysis, and the involvement of 'external data
sources' as a monad for the universe. This is an [[file:20200612T111010Z-idea.org][idea]], and / or a [[file:20200609T132052Z-projects.org][Project]].

* Basically what i think about things

- what do I mean by notetaking (operationalise)
  - like feynman, a thought process
  - recording facts about the world, and their relationships
  - systems for remembering
    - flashcards (anki, org-drill, etc)
  - for me, also graphical things
    - system diagrams
    - topologies
    - ontologies, taxonomy
  - hard work is important, but that doesn't mean that every part of the
    experience should be hard in equal proportion
- what is the experience?
  - paper
    - accessible, but in most cases, lower order, no easy way to follow a protocol
    - not machine readable, which might be okay, depending on who you are, and
      that which you consider ephemeral garbage
    - the data is natural language, and arbitrary graphics
    - can be shared pretty easily
  - onenote
    - handdrawing, typing, cell structure
    - proprietary, garbage, locked up cloud
    - much the same as other platforms - I would consider these as equal; pages,
      evernote, notion
    - sharing is usually okay, and as no reference system exists, you're
      probably copying & pasting everything in, or have some nightmare ETL
      reconciliation script like the ruby guys from the zettelkasten forum
  - roam / etc
    + a graph! a real cognitive leap
    + associative navigation is nice (n-ary context > category)
    + but everything is still lower order
  - so what's next?
    + text analysis
    + higher order objects (types? direction? recursion? composition?)
    + completion mechanism based on what you're looking at
    + make easy things automated
      - topic modelling, textrank on incoming data
    + extensible external data connectors / protocol
    + sharing, collaboration
    + arbitrary embeddings (transclusion)
